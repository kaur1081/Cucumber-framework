# Cucumber-framework
Created this framework with Behavior Driven development, Agile methodology.
Goal at  Sharp Healthcare was to Build an automation testing  framework available to all web development teams so that they can execute test cases and contribute to a project right from the start. 
In this project I used:
 cucumber, 
 Gherkin,
 nightwatch.js, 
 node js,
 Git collaboration,
 Jira,
 Testrail.
