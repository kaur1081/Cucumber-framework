# Cucumber-framework
Created this framework with Behavior Driven development, Agile methodology.
Goal at  Sharp Healthcare was to Build an automation testing  framework available to all web development teams so that they can execute test cases and contribute to a project right from the start. 
In this project I used:
 cucumber, 
 Gherkin,
 nightwatch.js, 
 node js,
 Git collaboration,
 Jira,
 Testrail.

Cucumber was use to write an acceptance test for a web application translating gherkin syntax into step definition.
Nightwatch.js is a javascript library used in an automated testing framework written in Node. There are many other libraries but I choose nightwatch as it is a convention in the company.
Node.js is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.
